<h1>The Impostor has officially been discontinued as of 03/06/2024</h1>
<h3>
  Hi everyone, today marks the END OF SUPPORT for The Impostor, and it has  already been offline for quite a while now.<br>
I'm ending support for a few reasons:<br>
1. The website I host it on has changed how their hosting works, hence why the bot is no longer online<br>
2. Lack of ideas, I haven't had a clue on what to add for ages<br>
3. The death of Among Us, I feel like it has fallen off, and therefore the bot is no longer going to grow<br>
4. Discord are soon going to remove the verified badge for the bot, and I haven't got the time to reverify<br><br>

I'd like to thank you all for your support, I never thought the bot would have been added to over 600 servers!<br>
Thank you for all, I will be publishing the code at <a href="https://github.com/bazthedev/The-Impostor">https://github.com/bazthedev/The-Impostor</a> soon.<br><br>

Once again, thank you for everything.
</h3>
