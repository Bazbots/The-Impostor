  Hi everyone, today marks the END OF SUPPORT for The Impostor, and it has  already been offline for quite a while now.
I'm ending support for a few reasons:
1. The website I host it on has changed how their hosting works, hence why the bot is no longer online
2. Lack of ideas, I haven't had a clue on what to add for ages
3. The death of Among Us, I feel like it has fallen off, and therefore the bot is no longer going to grow
4. Discord are soon going to remove the verified badge for the bot, and I haven't got the time to reverify

I'd like to thank you all for your support, I never thought the bot would have been added to over 600 servers!
Thank you for all, I will be publishing the code at <a href="https://github.com/bazthedev/The-Impostor">https://github.com/bazthedev/The-Impostor</a> soon.

Once again, thank you for everything.
</h3>
